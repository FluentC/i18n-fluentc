  "article-body-3": "Once upon a time, there was a designer named Alice who was tasked with creating a new mobile application for a multinational company. Excited about the opportunity, Alice dove into the project headfirst and began designing the interface.\n\nAs she was working, Alice realized that the app would need to support multiple languages. She knew that translations could be tricky, but she was confident that she could handle it. So, she added all of the text in the design to a Google Sheet and sent it off to the translation team.\n\nA few days later, the translations came back and Alice was ready to implement them into her design. However, as she began to add the new text, she quickly realized that something was off. The translations didn’t quite fit in the space she had allotted for them and some of the phrasings was awkward.\n\nAlice tried to fix the issues, but it was like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. The more she tried to make it work, the worse it became. She was getting frustrated and was running out of time to deliver the project.\n\nJust as she was about to give up, Alice heard about a new tool called FluentC. FluentC is an AI-powered translation management platform that allows designers to preview translations in context and make adjustments before implementation.\n\nAlice decided to give FluentC a try and was delighted to find that it was exactly what she needed. She was able to preview the translations in context and make adjustments before implementation, which saved her a lot of time and hassle.\n\nIn the end, Alice was able to deliver a high-quality, multilingual app that was well-received by the client. She learned that translations can be tricky, but with the right tools, they don’t have to be a headache.",

  "article-body-2": "One of our clients, a leading e-commerce company, learned this lesson the hard way. They had spent months designing and developing their mobile application, ensuring that every detail was perfect. They were confident that the application would be a hit with users, regardless of their language.\n\nThe team at the e-commerce company used Adobe XD to design their mobile application, taking advantage of its powerful design tools and prototyping capabilities. They spent countless hours perfecting the user interface, ensuring that every button and feature was intuitive and easy to use. They also put a lot of effort into making the application visually appealing, using Adobe XD’s design assets, and layout options.\n\nHowever, during the localization process, they realized that the translations of the design elements and text did not match the original intent and caused confusion among the users. The design elements that were meant to be visually appealing in one language became unappealing or even confusing in another language. The team realized that they needed to take a holistic approach to localization, and not just focus on the text translations, when the application was released in multiple languages, they received a flood of negative reviews from users who were frustrated with the poor translations. They quickly realized that they had made a crucial mistake by relying on low-quality machine translations instead of AI-Powered machine translations.\n\nThe company reached out to us, and we helped them implement FluentC, a powerful translation management system. FluentC allows them to easily manage translations and implement enhanced machine translations and available manual translations to ensure that the application is accurately translated into multiple languages, and also provided them with a way to handle the design elements translations, like images, icons, and layout. With FluentC, the team was able to easily manage translations to ensure that the application was accurately translated into multiple languages while keeping the design elements’ intent.\n\nWith FluentC, the company was able to quickly address translation issues and improve the user experience for its global audience. They were also able to save time and money by streamlining their translation workflow and avoiding the costly process of re-releasing the application.\n\nIn conclusion, building an application that is ready for users in multiple languages is a challenging task. However, it is essential for reaching a global audience. By using FluentC, you can easily manage translations to ensure that your application is accurately translated into multiple languages, saving time and money while providing a better user experience.",
  "article-body-4": "Localization and translation are crucial in the healthcare industry for a number of reasons.\nFirst and foremost, accurate and reliable translations ensure that patients from non-English speaking backgrounds have equal access to healthcare. This is particularly important for patients who may have limited English proficiency and cannot fully understand or communicate their medical needs. By providing translated materials and language support, healthcare providers can help ensure that these patients receive the same level of care as English-speaking patients.\n\nAdditionally, localization and translation are essential for effective communication and collaboration between healthcare providers. With an increasingly diverse patient population, it is important for healthcare providers to be able to communicate effectively with patients and their families, as well as with other healthcare professionals. This includes not only verbal communication, but also written materials such as medical charts, consent forms, and patient education materials.\n\nFurthermore, localization and translation are also important for the development and distribution of medical products and devices. Medical equipment and pharmaceuticals must be appropriately labeled and instructions translated in order to be used safely and effectively by non-English speaking patients. This also applies to clinical trials, where the participants and the researchers have to speak the same language, otherwise, the trial may not be reliable.\n\nIn summary, localization and translation play a critical role in ensuring that all patients have equal access to healthcare, facilitating effective communication and collaboration among healthcare providers, and ensuring the safe and effective use of medical products and devices. Without localization and translation, many patients would face language barriers that would prevent them from receiving the best possible care, and as a result, it is important for healthcare providers to invest in these services.",
